                stop the flow of water.As a result, the common people are floating everything in their houses.The flow
                of this water is not stopping in any way so we should all extend a helping hand for Sylhet bus from our
                respective places.Let's all help for the people of Sylhet.</p>

            <p class="second-content">Today, some relief has come from Dhaka to the north and from the south to Sylhet
                at the initiative of the City Corporation.If we compare the average human population, it is seen that
                the amount of life is much less.Today, the government has claimed the lives of about 20,000 people.We
                have all been able to give the packets of life from our committee to the people in some remote areas.You
                make arrangements to send relief to the people of Sylhet from all over Bangladesh as soon as possible
                and I am drawing the attention of those who are in exile. Come forward for the people of Sylhet.
